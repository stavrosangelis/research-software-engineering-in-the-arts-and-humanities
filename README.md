# Research Software Engineering in the Arts and Humanities

The [Research Software Engineering in the Arts and Humanities Community Interest Group](https://digitalhumanities-uk-ie.org/community-interest-groups/research-software-engineering/) is a community-driven group, part of the [UK-Ireland Digital Humanities Association](https://digitalhumanities-uk-ie.org/).

The AH RSE aims to offer a forum for the Research Software Engineering (RSE) community working and collaborating in Arts and Humanities across UK and Ireland for more focused discussion, expertise and knowledge exchange, action, advocacy and policy making towards the development of AH RSE capability.

The CIG recognises that AH RSEs belong to the broad category of Research Technology Professionals which UKRI acknowledges are key to the delivery of high quality research. It aims to work in alignment with the UK RSE Society and other relevant national initiatives in the UK and Ireland such as the Software Sustainability Institute and the Society of Research Software Engineers.

Coordinators: Stavros Angelis (Maynooth University), David Beavan (Alan Turing Institute), Kathryn Cassidy (Digital Repository of Ireland), Mary Chester-Kadwell (Cambridge University), and Anna-Maria Sichani (School of Advanced Study)
